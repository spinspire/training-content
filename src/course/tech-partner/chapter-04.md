# Searching for a Technology Partner: The breakdown
>Seeking out for a technical party from a nontechnical perspective, if you are not familiar with tech, is the first step of many steps one will be taking out of their comfort zone. It's almost like swimming in open ocean. You don't know what to expect and quite frankly, sometimes what to even look for. Here is a breakdown on what to look for.

To get the solution up and running, there are different ways to bring your technology partner into business with you. You can either build or buy your software. As both alternatives are expensive due to the heated market, one alternative can become significantly cheaper than the other in the long run. But every situation is different (falar mais aqui sobre porque alguma pode ser mais barata que a outra, compare and contrast- Pode ser em outro parÃ¡grafo)

## Build vs. Buy
>Given that one plays a nontechnical role, there are two primary forms of investing in technology. Different investment types can vary in delivery Time, price, and relationship with the technological party.

The compensation towards a technical party can be done in several ways, most comonly, through money and shares. when Insourcing, it is probably a good idea to offer some shares.

When software development companies in particular ar too big, they will take any given project above their starting price. Their goal is going to be conclude the project, whilst your goal will be to put the project to action.


### Insourcing
Insourcing technology, or hiring software developers into your company definitely has its advantages. Quality and price are two things that you need to consider when searching. There are two types of investments that could be made in insourcing. You can either bring in a team and put them on a payroll or you can bring in a technical co-founder and give him equity for being part of your venture. It is very unlikely that one person will be able to handle coding your project, but it can happen. If doing so, make sure

It is understandable that you may have a hard time judging on the quality. When you are

For starters, it is better seen in the eyes of technical investors that your company produces its own software rather than outsourcing it, as I am assuming it will be one of the main activities of your venture.

When insourcing, forms of compensation can include money, shares, or a mix of both. As now part of the company, showing them they have value is important. In this scenario, shares are usually seeked by developers for two main reasons. The first reason may be that, if a company cannot afford keeping the heavy salary of a development team, the developers can gain this compensation as an alternative. Secondly, by mixing forms of compensation, it keeps them motivated and can still benefit if fired from the company.

The downside of that is that one might be giving away a lot of future value based on indending to proceed with the development without enough resources. 

  

### Outsourcing
Outsourcing technology is the best way to guarantee yourself that you will have your solution done. Given they had experience in working with other ventures, they tend to build the solution quicker than a team they would assemble because they are already one. The talent inside a software development company, differently from the team you hire (if you are not hiring high-end developers) is most likely greater.

The big thing you should keep in mind when looking into different software development companies is for past clients' feedback. You should bare in mi

When outsourcing, the software development company will most likely only take monetary compensation due to their business model. This allows them to keep talent in payroll.

Apart from committing to the development contract, which is a budget that will be spend sooner than if insourcing (Can also depend on how the terms of payment look), there can me minor downsides but nothing that will affect one too much.
