# Understanding Technology:
> The first thing to reflect when building a software is if the technology is being built for an idea or is the idea being supported technology. Is the intent to facilitate or innovate a process of an already existing company or is a company/startup being founded around this new technology?

There is an abundance of existing technological resources one can acquire, subscribe or simply utilize for their business. Nowadays, it is very rare to come across businesses that does not count on softwares, as they facilitate running a scalable, errand-free operation. Often overseen if not perceived as the main activity of a given business, technology comes in play in the backstage of most successful ventures, whether as an internal or external software. The technological needs of a business differs from one another, depending on the intentions and objectives they plan on achieving when implementing the technology.

The alignment of the business activities and technological activities are vital in order for the execution of the project to succeed, putting one in a good position for a future blitzscale.

Despite scaling being important, it should not be done without the planning and understanding of any given sized business or enterprise how the next growth spree is going to look like and what resources will be needed to do so. With the first action always being from within, there are two different routes one can take. Innovating with an internal software is for businesses aiming to see a immediate impact in operations, and as a second step, putting them in a position to grow outwards by being able to handle a bigger traffic. On the other hand, an external software is designed to firstly impact the clientele with the intention to bring income, marketing results, and image likeness that will help power the backoffice through increased revenue.

|`Purpose:` |Organize communication and operations, as well as operational demands            |Quicker channel to client and tech. being build fot an idea          |
|`Users`    |Employees|Clients|

>The graph above presents the basics and differences between internal and external softwares.

Understanding if the software is internal or external will make a big difference down the stretch. This will affect many of the processes during the project such as urgency, budget, legal implications and some areas of the company.

Startups and companies with small operational demand can usually run with existing softwares, but as demand and scalability increases, it is in the best interest to internalize operations and build a BTS (Built to suit) softaware that will help develop a dependant-free business model.
  
## Technological Perspective
A computer science background is not necessary for every member involved on the project. In fact, separating jobs to be done is beneficial. The reason being is that just like technological roles have specialized themselves as such, so should the non-technological ones. Bring in someone that can do their job as well as you can do yours. Hire your weaknesses.

Worrying about the development won't help, but understanding the process will. To understand the technological perspective, a lot of time will be spent in developing a computer science knowledge. What is probably best to do is learn the basics of the scrum methodology, which will be mentioned again later.
