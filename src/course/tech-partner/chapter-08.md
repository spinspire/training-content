# Settling the relationship with your technology partner
>When a decision is already taken on who the technological partner is, laying out the terms in a contract and cultivating a relationship is important, for both sides.

As the development is about to conclude, the technological partner will have something to show for. This means that the core coding is done and some visuals begin to function. It is most likely that the software will not be fully functioning, but that's because it is not ready yet.

Last article it was mentioned that it is crucial for one to make sure the other areas of the business are in the same page as the development. Well, this is the time where operationally, you can be ahead of your time. As you have images, a sense of how it is really looking and a estimated delivery date with a safe buffer (better deliver earlier rather than later of a promise date) and a better idea of how it will really look and function, you can now begin to tease the users with a near implementation. Depending on who your target user is, this will allow you to either begin to pitch your solution to users  if external or heat the conversations if internal.

From this moment, there are two one can take it's relationship with the technical partner. Despite the development not being ready, software developers need to plan themselves ahead of time in order to understand if they can begin to allocate workforce for upcoming projects or if the developers will continue working on your solution.

### Relation
>As your relationship with your technological partner comes close to an end (if outsourcing was the option chosen), there are two ways to go from here:

One of the biggest issues with discontinuing the relationship with the technical founder is that some time of the non-technical team will need to be allocated to understanding how to maintain and run a software.

#### End of relationship
If the non-technical founder is satisfied with the solution and wish to store the app, some advising will need to be done so that the app maintain itself up and running. This is completely doable if one gets ahead on how to do so.

#### Continuity of relationship
Almost treating like a 'cost of insurance' to maintain the software running, software development companies usually work with two types of post-development contracts.
The first type of contract is a sustain contract. This means the non-technical partner pays a relatively small fee in order for the technical one to be responsible of maintaining the software running.
The second type of contract is a development contract. Usually offered in several prices, this contract is basically the maintenance of the one above, but it also counts with a number of hours of development as well. The price of the contract will be directly correlated with the amount of hours you would like the technical founder to devote on developing other functionalities and slowly adding to the MVP.
