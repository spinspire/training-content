# Predevelopment Understanding
>Putting the project to paper is a good way of evaluating crucial points of what this project will require from the business/back-office and the non-technical responsible himself.

As a initial sketch to begin visualizing the project as a whole, one could use parts of a pitch deck format to evaluate if the idea is worth proceeding with. Allow some points on the pitch deck to be incomplete, as it is better than filling the voids with false or unrealistic information. It is important to be cautious of gathering information solely with research, as results are often  generalized, it may turn out to be misleading. The processes of a technological journey are not standardized and varies for most of the projects.

### Market research
One of the wonders of technology is that it expand the business' SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market). What sets the barriers of entry into the SAM (service Available Market) and the TAM (Total Available Market) are things such as location and access to customers. With that being said, blue oceans become red faster. When researching about other players, also consider how much can they grow and where can they be by the time one's new solution is up and running.

**~~Picture 3**~~   

>The image above shows an example of entering a blue ocean without technology. To the left, the SOM can be barely untapped, the sam have a couple of options and the TAM have solutions, but one barely affects the others' businesss, as it is hard to obtain. To the left, what can sound like a local or simple problem will have more solutions trying to gather users to use different forms of solutions for the problem at SAM, and a unbounded amount of solutions at the TAM, as technology can help one reach anyone anywhere. 

The market research should not only be about similar players or solutions, but also other about others that help solve the same problem one's looking to eliminate. The first line of thought prior to beginning the search should be, in order to create a solution that will solve the problem, is fixing one step of the way enough or do I need to fix the whole path in order for the pain to really be solved. This will help you understand if little solutions combined will do your job if put together. As an example, just because you want to create an automated lock for homes, it doesn’t mean you need to create a solution for the residence car gate. Even though they seem like similar markets, different technologies come in play. It’s almost like you are creating two products. The problem one feels the need to address should be enough of a pain for a company/community/society, that enlarging the scope of the idea should not need to be done in order for one to believe the problem will be solved.

Trying to solve every single step of the way will enlarge the scope of the MVP will raise costs as well as potentially repel innovators and early adopters, as they are committing to a solution bigger than their need. A MVP that fails to test the product-market fit will likely take it's next steps blindfolded.

### Marketing

#### Internal
When marketing internally to employees, a onboarding should be done in order to train them how to use the software.

#### External
At the starting point, if the __technology is being built around the idea__ the assumption is that the company/startup is already up and running and a marketing team most likely exists. This team doesn't necessarily need to market the technology, but rather what it is going to change for their user/client.

In the case of __building and idea around technology__, the 7 P's of marketing should be a core knowledge. A rundown of the 7 P's of marketing should be carefully drawn out to validade the idea is worth building. If any of the 7 P's are unclear, it is in the best interest that they are redone and reevaluated as many times as it takes before taking the first step of the project.

## Conclusion
Know your idea. Know exactly what you need in a business and operational standpoint. Before embarking onto the development phase, make sure you know  give yourself enough time on. As soon as you commit into starting your project, stepbacks can cost you time and money. Standing on what you believe the final outcome will look like is important.
