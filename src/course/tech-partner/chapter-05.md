# How To Evaluate Your Technology Partner
> When narrowing down the list of technological contenders, are sure 

At this point you may now have dug in deeper and weighed in the advantages and disadvantages of insourcing and outsourcing your technology. This can be a very overwhelming step of the process because it is sometimes hard to evaluate how good the technology is and what should be paid for it. As some may think, technology it’s not binary in the sense that it either works or it doesn't. Bugs and wrong programming language are two examples of faults that can happen when the technology isn’t properly coded. Inexperience or the wrong programming language can lead to such problems previously mentioned. As you are protecting yourself through a NDA, you can feel free to speak about your project with a technology partner. You do not need to open up about operational practices or other resources you have, but it is recommended to be as clear as possible about what you need from the technological aspect. Leaving details behind would lead to a misunderstanding from the technological party. By giving the same information to everyone you speak about it would give you a mean time and budget for completion, with a standard deviation of what’s on the range and what’s too good to be true or too far that deserves to be disregarded as an option.

There are some questions you'd probably want to make when coming to the financial aspect such as:
• What you are paying for
• How is this project being assembled
• is there a team allocated to the project?
• Is it only one full stack engineer?
• Apart from the technological stance, what else are you getting from the technology you’re either buying or building
•  Are they willing to do status meetings every week? Every two weeks?

After considering all these factors, ask them about the follow-up process. Do they support any bugs or errors after the delivery of the project? If so, for how long? Do they give you the (código fonte) or do you keep it to yourself? These are all questions you should be shooting at your technology partner.

The quality and time estimated for the completion of your project are correlated with the cost. It is okay to have a timeline in mind, but be fair with the developers as well. Trying to shrink time will probably increase cost and create coding blindspots, which will later on need to be redone.

You should not be taken by the idea that a company or a team you insourced will finish the project within half of the timeline someone else gave you- it will most likely not run smoothly an

When settling the last remarks about the partnership, make sure you're familiar of who you're settling with. If possible, invite the developers, whether insourcing or outsourcing, into your company or visit where they are settled to create a sense of culture while developing the project.
