Dear enthusiasts, founders, enterprise representatives, and leaders of change.

This nine-chapter guide approaches different steps of the journey with an unbiased, undisclosed perspective of what developing and conducting a technological project really looks like.

The target audience of this guide are primarily people who do not have enough technical knowledge to develop a software themselves. The ultimate goal of these publications is to make non-technological partners that may be hesitant to begin this journey feel comfortable by providing enough information and guidance about what the steps look like without finding out throughout the process.

• Chapter 04: Budget
• Chapter 05: How To Evaluate Your Technology Partner
• Chapter 06: Building Your Technology

By the end of this read, one should feel mindful about knowing what to look for when searching for a technological partner to develop a software, and the blueprint of how a technological project is stuctured and delivered. Hopefully, you'll feel encouraged to brainstorm on ways you could impact your workplace, clients, community or society with through the development of technology, and who knows, embark on a technological journey with whomever it might be.
