# Building your MVP
>Potential scalability is very important for every business to maintain themselves competitive amongst other players in the market. But the evolution orbits the main focus.

Considering one has already a formed partnership with a non-technical partner, the definition of the minimum viable product scope should be debated and agreed upon. The scope of this project will define, now better than ever, the cost and duration of development.

The technical partner's experience will weight in when building the scope, as one that has much of, will be able to say with a better degree of precision on both cost and time.

Even though it might be tempting to make slight adjustments to the MVP if they are not going to cost any extra, make sure that those additions make sense in the building of the project. As previously mentioned in **"Article name"**, overstepping can not only cost you users if an external solution, but it can literally cost you a lot more money. As shown on the image below, thr MVP should be straight forward. The understanding of the idea is the circle as a whole, but the MVP is the heart of the funcionality. At this point in time, it is important to think on the price-per-feature. Is adding this going to make a difference on the revenue? This is a question that needs to be asked multiple times throughout the process of understanding your MVP.

## Scoping
>Having a good discussion with your technological partner can make the solution more viable.

Although the non-technical party is responsible for the idea, sometimes the adjustment of a couple of features of unforeseen complexity can be advised to be removed by them. When pitching the idea you want to develop with your technical partner, make sure to include him on the conversation. A technical partner, even though hired for the purpose of developing, should also feel like he is in a position to respectfully give an input if he feels like. You want minds like this acting like if that was their project too. Let them treat it like they are part of it, and the outcome will be seen on a further point.

With innumerous solutions out there, even though it has been stressed enough to keep your MVP simple, make sure it doesn't fit a white label model.

>White label models have no market traction because they are of easy access on a probably better cost for the customer.

If developing a solution similar to a white label software, make sure to add something disruptive. Opportunity comes in disruption rather than complexity.

## Developing
>Often done in sprints, some processes need to be complete before beginning others, whilst some can be done simultaneously.

The development of the project should be mapped out in sprints in order for the project manager have an accurate estimation if the project will be delivered on time. 

(insert image example of basic sprints ex approval of UI, back end dev, etc and has some overlap with others)

As shown above, one of the examples previously cited shows  that the design of the UI is essential for the **"phase"** to be developed. In case the UI is approved by the non-technological party, then wanted to be adjusted d=at a further point in time. This will delay the project as all steps will need to be redone.
